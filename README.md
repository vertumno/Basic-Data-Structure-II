# Basic Data Structure II (Class notes and codes)

I'm storing here assignements given in Basic Data Structures II classes. Each directory has its own README with instructions.

<b>Attention: Some implementations may contain errors. Most of them have been spotted so far, but I've decided to leave them. Here my learning curve (as well as my evolution as a programmer/computer scientist) can be observed.</b>

Enjoy and feel free to use/reproduce/distribute any piece of code in this repository, as long as you reference me.
