# Trees - Implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST)

In the present repository I'm storing the codes created to implement a Binary Search Tree.

<b>Lucas Gomes Dantas</b> (<dantaslucas@ufrn.edu.br>), student in the <b>Basic Data Structure II</b> class of <b>Prof. Dr. Jorge Estefano Santana de Souza</b> at <b>Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte</b>.

## Implemented functions

* <code>public boolean insert (Object data)</code> - Receives one Object and stores it a its proper position on Tree;
* <code>public Object find (int key)</code> - Searches for an object inside the Tree that matches the given key;
* <code>public void printTree()</code> - Calls function print() from class TreePrinter and prints to client all the values stored within the BST;
* <code>public boolean delete(int key)</code> - Deletes an Object from the BST that matches the given key.

There are some private helper functions, you can find them by checking the <code>BinarySearchTree.java</code> file.

Also, do not forget to check out <code>Node.java</code>, the Node structure was hidden from this README. 

## Compiling and running

The main focus was to provide the source code of the project. You can add them to Eclipse, IntelliJ or whatever option you prefer and compile/execute.
